            Today's journalism evolution the major push to put information out
            on a global scale platform. The ultimate goal of journalism being
            able to serve people around the world with information that can be
            beneficial to consumers. No matter if you know who the information
            is being read by or not there is that responsibility.{" "}

            There will be plenty of people around the world who may like the
            content as well as those whom do not. Every country presents its own
            unique aspects and sometimes challenges as far the codes correlated
            with Journalism codes today. "Truth", "accuracy", and "objectivity"
            are cornerstones of journalism ethics. Journalists should strive to
            detach themselves from regions, groups and even countries they
            reside from or in to an extent. Allowing for that separation to
            prevent influenced bias play a part in their journalistic writing.
            So many journalists today fall victim to this trap hole and become
            stuck where they are once they have fallen in. Certain countries
            prefer to only have certain information put out and in certain
            contexts.
